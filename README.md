<p align="center"> i like 2 give the benefit of doubt that there is good deep down in every1, and want 2 give a chance (..◜ᴗ◝..) but I know that sumtimes that is not the case with every1 and they wont change, but regardless i will always root 4 their development and hope every1 can be happi and healthy!!!!! I do want 2 let every1 know that if you dont follow the basic DNI like "dni if proshipper, pedo, being weird in gen" then I prolly wont like 2 talk 2 you (◞‸ ◟) just know that if you are these kinds of things, i hope you seek the help you need and realize what you are doing =^♡^=
